## Projects With Python/Excel/Power BI

<br><br>
## 1.Mental Health Illness Analysis
<br>
Mental health is a topic of immense interest and importance to me, which is why I embarked on this project to analyze relevant data. As someone who is passionate about promoting mental wellness and addressing mental health stigma, I was excited to undertake this endeavor and gain a deeper understanding of the subject. I firmly believe that mental health is a critical component of overall well-being, and it's essential to have accurate and comprehensive data to guide our efforts in promoting and supporting mental health. Through this analysis, I aim to contribute to the ongoing conversation about mental health and help uncover insights that can inform future policies and interventions.

### About the project

#### Summary
<br>
The analysis of mental health data revealed several insights, including higher rates of depression and anxiety among young adults, mental health disparities among marginalized communities, and increasing rates of suicidal ideation among females. It was also discovered that the rate of mental health illnesses among females is nearly double that of males. This analysis identified the most important factors contributing to mental health illness

#### Objective
<br>
1. Collect and prepare the 17 years of the USA mental health illness data (1990 to 2017).

2. Combine, clean, and process the dataset to get ready for analysis.

3. Analyze the dataset, and visualize using Power BI and R programming

4. Share the conclusion of this analysis to help guide the development of effective and targeted interventions to promote mental health and well-being.

#### Key Findings
- The analysis showed that the rate of mental health illness has gradually increased over a period of 17 years, with a significant 24.61% increase observed in 2017 when compared to rates in 1990

- The rate of females experiencing mental health illnesses is approximately double that of males.

- The analysis found that people within the age range of 20-24 years old are the most affected by mental health illnesses

- Based on the analysis, the three factors that exert the greatest influence in contributing to depression are drug disorders, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders.

- The analysis identified a strong positive correlation between drug disorder and depression, indicating that drug disorder is the most influential factor contributing to depression.

##  2.Healthcare Insurance Analysis
Healthcare costs have been increasing rapidly in recent years, posing significant challenges to individuals, families, and the healthcare system as a whole. The analysis of factors that affect healthcare costs is an important tool for policymakers, insurance providers, and healthcare providers in understanding the drivers of healthcare costs and developing strategies to ensure access to quality healthcare services at affordable prices.
### About the project
#### Purpose
This study aims to analyze the factors that affect healthcare costs and provide insights into their impact on insurance charges. The study will explore the relationships between insurance charges and various demographic and health-related factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking status, geographic location, and the number of children.
#### The questions need to be answered  
  1. Are there differences in insurance charges between males and females?

  2. How do age and BMI affect insurance charges?

  3. What is the difference in insurance charges between smokers and non-smokers?

  4. Are there any differences in insurance charges in different geographic locations?

  5. How does the number of kids affect insurance charges?

  6. What is the most important factor that affects insurance charges?
  
####  Objectives
- Collect and prepare healthcare insurance data of 1,339 people.

- Combine, clean, and process datasets to get ready for analysis.

- Analyze dataset using Excel Toolpak and Pivot Table

- Share the conclusion of this analysis with policymakers, insurance providers, and healthcare providers in understanding the drivers of healthcare costs and developing strategies to ensure access to quality healthcare services at affordable prices
#### Regression Analysis

The R Squared value is over 75% and the Significance F value is below 0.5, which indicates a meaningful correlation between the input variables and the output variable of insurance charges. Taking a closer look at the P-value for each of the individual variables, there is a bit more information about the significance of each of the individual variables. The variables “age”, “BMI”, “children”, and “smoker” are strongly correlated with charges. There is also a slightly less significant correlation between the output variable and “region.” The variable “gender” does not appear to have a strong correlation with costs, as its p-value is much higher than 0.05.

 Gender is not a significant factor affecting insurance charges, while age, BMI, and smoking status are the most important factors impacting insurance costs. Non-smokers pay a much lower insurance cost than smokers. It may be said that elders, people with high BMI, or smokers have a high level of health risks, which leads to a higher insurance cost. Regions also influence insurance costs, Southeast and Northeast pay a higher charge than other regions, while the number of children has a light correlation with the insurance cost.

 <img src="images/4.4.png?raw=true"/>
#### Key Findings
- R square = 75%. The difference in input variables explains 75% of the difference in insurance charges.

- Age, BMI, smoking status, and the number of children are the most critical factors affecting insurance costs, while the regions also influence insurance costs, but it is not a major factor.

- Gender is not a significant factor impacting insurance charge

- People who have obesity, especially obesity level 2, tend to pay more insurance cost 

- The elders pay higher insurance costs than others

- Smokers pay 3 times more insurance costs than non-smokers, regardless of their gender.

- People living in the southeast and the northeast pay higher than in other regions

## 3.E-commerce Analysis
E-commerce has become an essential part of modern business operations, providing a platform for businesses to sell their products and services to customers worldwide. The growth of E-commerce has been fueled by the increasing number of internet users and the convenience it offers. E-commerce data analysis has become an essential tool for businesses to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, identify trends, and optimize their operations.
### About the Project
#### Purpose
Analyzing sales data to identify the most successful city, popular products, and optimal selling times can help businesses to target their marketing efforts, adjust product offerings, and increase sales. Understanding customer buying patterns through e-commerce data analysis is crucial for businesses to optimize their sales and marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
#### Questions need to be answered
- Which cities have the highest sales revenue?  Is there any trend in sales revenue

- What is the maximum number of orders? What are the peak hours for order placement?

- Which products are most commonly sold together? Are there any patterns in the combination of products that customers buy together?
